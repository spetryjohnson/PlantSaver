Django web app for automating the watering of my houseplants with a Raspberry Pi.

I can't imagine this is useful to anyone but me, for for posterity I'm using a BC Robotics irrigation HAT for a Raspberry Pi to water some houseplants. This is a custom Django website I created for automating the pumps and tracking status.

Do with this what you will.
